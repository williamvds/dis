	analysis. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time

	brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce
	valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the
	context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It
	provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing,
	filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting
	dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network
	visualization.",
